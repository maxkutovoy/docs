For any one stumbling on this looking for older RPM/DEBs stable Chrome packages, you can use the following official link format, I don't know what is the retention policy but it seems Chrome keeps roughly the last year or so worth of versions.

RPM: https://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/x86_64/google-chrome-stable-[CHROME_VERSION]-1.x86_64.rpm

DEB: http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_[CHROME_VERSION]-1_amd64.deb

Replace [CHROME_VERSION] with the version you want, you can look for release versions in https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases

Make sure you set the top dropdown to Linux, the stable versions will be on the left. For example if you want an RPM package for version 127.0.6533.119 then you would use:

https://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/x86_64/google-chrome-stable-127.0.6533.119-1.x86_64.rpm
